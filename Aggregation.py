# method example
# what about private attribute


# INHERITENCE 

# A class can inherit from another class.
# Inheritance improves code reuse
# Constructor, attributes, methods get inherited to the child class
# The parent has no access to the child class
# Private properties of parent are not accessible directly in child class
# Child class can override the attributes or methods. This is called method overriding
# super() is an inbuilt function which is used to invoke the parent class methods and constructor

# Example

# parent
class User:

  def __init__(self):
    self.name = 'nitish'
    self.gender = 'male'

u = User()
s = Student()

print(u.name)
s.login()
s.enroll()
